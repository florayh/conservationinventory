Code written by Yifan He. 

 
Dependencies: Code was written in R (4.3.2). 
Required R packages are tidyverse (2.0.0), readxl (1.4.3), paletteer (1.6.0) and RColorBrewer (1.1.3)

  
Summary of scripts: 
1) Tables_Figures.Rmd: code to produce all quantitative tables and figures from pre-processed data. 

 
Pre-processing scripts are not included in this repository due to sharing restrictions of some source datasets.


Additional scripts available upon request:
1) area_calculations.R: calculate area by system subfamily/country/biome/land. 
2) compare_WDPA.R: compare category coverage of our 2016 Amazon dataset with the 2016 version of WDPA, and the 2023 version of WDPA + WD-OECM
